* Click on 'Create New Repository'.

* Name the repository, description and choose whether it should be public or private.

* If file already exists , we can upload them using Upload file option.

* If not , we can create new file using Create file option.

* Once done , we should commit the changes.

* If we need to make changes in code , we should create seperate branch to avoid the new code affecting the existing one.

* Once we are good with the newly created code we can merge them into master branch.
